 * Window-close gate. Two jobs:
 *
 *  1. Durably flush the workspace snapshot before the window goes away. The
 *     per-change save is fire-and-forget and can be mid-write when the app quits
 *     or an update relaunches it, which is the "close a pane but it's back on
 *     reopen" symptom.
 *  2. Prompt when terminals are still working (see `isSessionBusy`), offering
 *     the two quits that actually differ: a light quit leaves the sessions with
 *     the PTY daemon - it outlives the GUI, so a build or agent keeps running and
 *     the tabs reattach on next launch - or a force quit that kills them all.
 *     Nothing to prompt about (no busy terminal) means no dialog.
 *
 * Safety: hard timeout races on both the kill and the flush, and an always-run
 * destroy in `finally` so a slow or failed step can never hang the close. Once
 * the quit is committed, a further close request is left alone (no
 * preventDefault) so Tauri's own destroy still gets the window out - an escape
 * hatch if anything in `finish` stalls. While the prompt is merely open the
 * guard is still clear, so clicking X again just re-reads the busy count.
